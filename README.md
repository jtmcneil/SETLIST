This is a web app that will allow users to upload content for publishing to various platforms (i.e. Instagram, Facebook, Youtube, TikTok, etc...) all at the same time from the same place. Additionally users will be able to schedule the content for publishing at some point in the future.

Requirements:

-   Integration with Instagram / Facebook, TikTok, and Youtube
-   Instant and Scheduled publishing to each of these platforms
-   Photo and Video content support
-   User Authentication and Authorization

Stack:

-   Node.js - Server Runtime
-   Next.js - React Framework
-   MongoDB - User DB (also works natively with agenda)
-   Agenda - Scheduling Library
-   Tailwind - Styling

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
